# LDTS_T13_G06 - RETRO LEAGUE

## Game Description

The Retro League is a game inspired by the Lethal League game, a 2D arena fighting game. 

In this game, two players are put into an arena where they have to hit a ball into their opponent to win. However, there are a few tricks to it:
- each player has the chance to catch the ball avoiding being hit,
- there are power ups that can change the game's outcome by affecting the players and the ball,
- the ball bounces off the walls which can lead to a player beign hit by their own launch,

testing the players' strategy and reflexes.
