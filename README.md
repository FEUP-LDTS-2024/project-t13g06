# LDTS_T13_G06 - RETRO LEAGUE

## Game Description

The Retro League is a game inspired by the Lethal League game, a 2D arena fighting game. 

In this game, one player is put into an arena where he has to avoid being hit by a ball for as long as he can. However, there are a few tricks to it as there are power-ups that can change the game's outcome by affecting the ball and the player, and the ball bounces off the walls which can lead to a player beign hit unexpectedly,

testing the player's strategy and reflexes.
